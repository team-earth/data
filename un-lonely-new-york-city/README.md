1. **Goal**  
   → *Improve loneliness in New York*

2. **Obstacles**  
   → 8 major themes, such as “Urban Anonymity” and “Social Disparities”

3. **Sub-obstacles**  
   → Specific barriers like “Language barriers” or “High cost of dining out”

4. **Solutions**  
   → Actionable ideas proposed for each sub-obstacle

5. **Resources**  
   → Real-world organizations already implementing those solutions

Each solution and resource is contextually mapped and hyperlinked.
