# Food Security in Nova Scotia

This folder contains the structured outline for a systems-level map titled:  
**Food Security in Nova Scotia: A Systems Map of Challenges and Potential Solutions**

This resource outlines a community-informed understanding of food insecurity in Nova Scotia. It uses a radially hierarchical model to identify root causes, social barriers, and strategic solutions—organized in a way that allows for future inclusion of resource-level data.

## 🌟 Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Food insecurity in Nova Scotia will be reduced, and all residents will have stable, sufficient, and dignified access to food.*

Unlike some of the other maps in this collection, this edition focuses on structure only: it identifies what needs to be addressed and how, but does not yet include specific programs or organizations implementing the solutions.

This format still enables:
- Community planning
- Gap analysis
- Funding alignment
- AI-supported exploration of potential interventions

## 🧠 Radial Structure

This map follows the same five-layer structure used across this collection:

1. **Goal** – A food-secure Nova Scotia  
2. **Major Obstacles** – Structural and systemic drivers of food insecurity  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** – Specific manifestations of those obstacles  
4. **Solutions** – Strategic interventions and ideas  
5. *(Resources)* – *To be added in a future edition*

## 📁 Files in This Directory

- `Food Security in Nova Scotia.pdf` – Narrative and visual overview of the map  
- `food-security-nova-scotia.json` – Radial structure (goal → solutions) with no resource layer  
- `README.md` – This file

## ❗ Note on Resources

This edition does **not yet include** a companion resource metadata file. A future version may introduce a `food-security-nova-scotia-resources.json` that lists organizations and initiatives aligned with the proposed solutions.

## 🧠 Systems Approach

This map is built using a published cognitive and systems-thinking framework designed for clarity in complex, multi-stakeholder environments:
