# Food Security in Nova Scotia

This folder contains the structured outline for the systems-level guidebook:  
**Food Security in Nova Scotia: A Systems Map of Challenges and Potential Solutions**

This book lays out a community-informed understanding of food insecurity in Nova Scotia. It uses a radially hierarchical model to identify the root causes, social barriers, and proposed solutions—organized in a way that allows for future inclusion of resource-level data.

## 🌟 Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Food insecurity in Nova Scotia will be reduced, and all residents will have stable, sufficient, and dignified access to food.*

Unlike previous volumes in this series, this edition focuses on structure only: it identifies what needs to be addressed and how, but does not yet include specific programs or organizations implementing the solutions.

This format still enables:
- Community planning
- Gap analysis
- Funding alignment
- AI-supported exploration of potential interventions

## 🧠 Hierarchical Model

This book follows the same five-layer structure as others in the series:

1. **Goal** – A food-secure Nova Scotia  
2. **Major Obstacles** – Structural and systemic drivers of food insecurity  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** – Specific manifestations of those obstacles  
4. **Solutions** – Strategic interventions and ideas  
5. *(Resources)* – *To be added in a future edition*

## 📁 Files in This Directory

- `Food Security in Nova Scotia.pdf` – Narrative and visual overview of the map  
- `food-security-nova-scotia.json` – Radial structure (goal → solutions) with no resource nodes  
- `README.md` – This file

## ❗ Note on Resources

This edition does **not include** a resource metadata file. Future versions may include a companion `food-security-nova-scotia-resources.json` to list and connect specific programs and initiatives.

## 🧠 Systems Approach

This book is built using a published systems-thinking and cognitive decision-support framework:

> *A Proposed Practical Problem-Solving Framework for Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives in Socio-Ecological Systems*  
> [Read on arXiv →](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13155.pdf)
