# Ottawa: Resilient to Extremism

This folder contains the structured outline, dataset, and resource links for the systems-level guidebook:  
**Ottawa: Resilient to Extremism**  
A community-based framework for preventing the spread of extremist tactics by strengthening social bonds, trust, and inclusion in Canada's capital city.

## üåü Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Ottawa will be resilient to extremist tactics that attempt to divide, radicalize, or destabilize communities.*

This guide helps individuals and institutions recognize the structures that extremist movements seek to exploit. It outlines systemic vulnerabilities and surfaces programs already working to build resilience across neighborhoods, schools, institutions, and civic networks.

Using a consistent systems-thinking framework, the problem is mapped across five layers:

1. **Goal** ‚Äì A more connected and resilient Ottawa  
2. **Major Obstacles** ‚Äì Root-level factors that enable extremism to take hold  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Lived challenges and specific vulnerabilities  
4. **Solutions** ‚Äì Actionable, evidence-aligned responses  
5. **Resources** ‚Äì Real-world programs and organizations working on these issues

## üìÅ Files in This Directory

- `Ottawa Resilient to Extremism.pdf` ‚Äì Full printable version of the guide  
- `ottawa-resilient-to-extremism.json` ‚Äì Radial structure of the model (goal ‚Üí solutions ‚Üí resource IDs)

## üß† How the JSON Files Work Together

- The **mindmap file** (`ottawa-resilient-to-extremism.json`) defines the system of problems and solutions.
- The **resources file** (`ottawa-resilient-to-extremism-resources.json`) provides detailed information about each organization or program, linked by ID.

This split allows for easier updates, AI integration, and visualization.

## üß† Systems Approach

This guide is based on a published cognitive and systems-thinking framework that supports cross-sector collaboration and clarity in the face of complex challenges:
