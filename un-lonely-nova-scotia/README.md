## üåü Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Loneliness in Nova Scotia will be improved.*

This book breaks down the root causes of loneliness in Nova Scotia and proposes clear, actionable solutions‚Äîeach linked to real-world organizations, programs, or initiatives already working to solve the problem.

2. **Major Obstacles** ‚Äì Ten core challenges that make loneliness worse  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Specific ways these barriers manifest in daily life  
4. **Solutions** ‚Äì Practical strategies to address sub-obstacles  
5. **Resources** ‚Äì Organizations and initiatives currently implementing those solutions
