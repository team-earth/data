# Un-Lonely Nova Scotia

This folder contains the complete structured outline, dataset, and resource links for the systems-level guidebook:  
**Un-Lonely Nova Scotia: A Comprehensive Outline with Actions for Community Members, Organizations, and Policy Makers**

## üåü Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Loneliness in Nova Scotia will be improved.*

This book breaks down the root causes of loneliness in Nova Scotia and proposes clear, actionable solutions‚Äîeach linked to real-world organizations, programs, or initiatives already working to solve the problem.

Like its companion volume, *Un-Lonely New York City*, this guide is structured as a **radially hierarchical mindmap** with five layers:

1. **Goal** ‚Äì Improve social connectedness across Nova Scotia  
2. **Major Obstacles** ‚Äì Ten core challenges that make loneliness worse  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Specific ways these barriers manifest in daily life  
4. **Solutions** ‚Äì Practical strategies to address sub-obstacles  
5. **Resources** ‚Äì Organizations and initiatives currently implementing those solutions

## üìÅ Files in This Directory

- `Un-Lonely Nova Scotia.pdf` ‚Äì The complete guidebook with narrative, outline, and solution listings  
- `un-lonely-nova-scotia.json` ‚Äì The full radially hierarchical structure of goals, obstacles, sub-obstacles, and linked resource IDs

## üß† How the JSON Files Work Together

- **`un-lonely-nova-scotia.json`** is the structural mindmap of the problem and its solutions.  
  It includes references to specific resource IDs at the outermost layer.

- **`un-lonely-nova-scotia-resources.json`** contains detailed entries for those resources, matched by ID.  
  This allows separation of structure and content, enabling easier reuse, updating, and visualization.

Together, they allow both human readers and software tools (including AI) to navigate from high-level goals down to detailed real-world programs ‚Äî or vice versa.

## üß† Systems Approach

This guide applies a published framework that blends:
- Human cognitive problem-solving structures  
- Systems thinking  
- AI-assisted mapping of problems and resources
