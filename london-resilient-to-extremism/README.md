# London: Resilient to Extremism

This folder contains the structured outline, dataset, and linked resource metadata for the systems-level guidebook:  
**London: Resilient to Extremism**  
A practical framework to help community members, organizations, and local leaders strengthen resilience against extremist tactics and reinforce social cohesion in London.

## üåü Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *London will be resilient to extremist tactics that seek to divide, manipulate, or radicalize communities.*

This guide identifies structural and social vulnerabilities that extremist groups exploit, and proposes real-world solutions‚Äîbacked by programs already operating across the city.

Using a consistent systems-based framework, the problem is broken into five layers:

1. **Goal** ‚Äì A resilient, inclusive London  
2. **Major Obstacles** ‚Äì Key social fractures and systemic risks  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì The specific points where manipulation or division takes root  
4. **Solutions** ‚Äì Targeted strategies to build resilience  
5. **Resources** ‚Äì Programs and institutions implementing those strategies
