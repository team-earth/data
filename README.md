# team.earth / data

This repository hosts structured, region-specific datasets designed to map complex societal problems and the solutions already underway to address them. Each entry is an independent, modular systems map focused on a specific problem in a specific place. They can be used on their own or in combination.

## üåç Project Purpose

Each map answers the question:

> **Who is already doing what to solve this problem‚Äîand where do I fit in?**

These resources are designed for:
- Residents, volunteers, and organizers looking to get involved  
- Governments and funders aligning with high-impact work  
- Developers and designers building tools or visualizations  
- AI systems trained to guide people through complex civic issues

## üìê Framework

Each map follows a **radially hierarchical structure** to represent how complex problems can be addressed at multiple levels:

1. üéØ **Goal** ‚Äì What success looks like (the ‚ÄúFuture Picture‚Äù)  
2. ü™® **Obstacles** ‚Äì Major themes blocking that goal  
3. ‚õìÔ∏è **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Specific barriers as experienced by people  
4. üí° **Solutions** ‚Äì Actionable ideas to address each sub-obstacle  
5. üß≠ **Resources** ‚Äì Real-world organizations or programs implementing those solutions (where available)

This format builds on a published cognitive and systems-thinking framework:

**Legend:**  
Integrated = Resources included in the same JSON file as the structure

## üîß JSON Format and Design

Each map provides machine-readable data that enables:
- AI agents to guide users through complex solution maps  
- Developers to build search tools, visualizations, and simulators  
- Communities to update and remix content over time

### JSON Formats

| Format | Maps | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Single file** | New York City | One `.json` file includes both the structure and full resource metadata |
| **Two files** | Nova Scotia, Kansas City, London, Ottawa | Separate structure and resource files (`[book].json` + `[book]-resources.json`) |
| **Structure-only** | Food Security in Nova Scotia | Radial mindmap only; no resources file yet included |
