# team.earth data
Data behind the "Unsolvable: Think Again!" e-book series

This repository contains structured, location-based datasets and solution maps for tackling complex social problems at the community level. Each dataset represents a *"problem-solving book"*, where a deep analysis of the issue is translated into a hierarchical outline of obstacles, solutions, and real-world programs.

These books are published under the **team.earth** initiative, and all follow a consistent, structured methodology rooted in systems thinking and collaborative action.

## 🧭 Purpose

To empower community members, nonprofits, policymakers, and funders with:

- A **map of who is doing what** to solve complex problems in their city or region
- A **framework** for aligning scattered efforts toward shared goals
- A **living document** for coordination, recognition, and strategic support

## 📚 Book Directories

Each subdirectory under `/data/` is a standalone “book” that includes:

- A printable PDF version with contextual essays and a structured outline
- A `*.json` file representing the hierarchical problem breakdown
- A public Google Map of geocoded resources
- A localized README explaining the project

| Book Directory | Region / Theme            | Goal Summary                           | PDF | JSON | Map |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------|------|-----|
| `un-lonely-new-york-city/` | New York City – Loneliness | Improve social connection across NYC  | [PDF](./un-lonely-new-york-city/Un-Lonely%20New%20York%20City%20PDF%20r.pdf) | [JSON](./un-lonely-new-york-city/un-lonely-new-york-city.json) | [View Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1jfIz0rAfu2L8w3gEdjKIxq0BfDGMr3E) |

## 🧠 Methodology

This repository is built on a published framework:

> **A Proposed Practical Problem-Solving Framework for Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives**  
> Based on a model of the human cognitive problem-solving process.  
> 📄 [Read on arXiv (1911.13155)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13155.pdf)

The model’s core steps:
1. Define a **Future Picture Statement** (e.g., “Loneliness in NYC will be improved”)
2. Identify **major obstacles** to this future
3. Break them into **facets** and **components**
4. Propose **solutions** for each component
5. Index **real-world resources** already implementing those solutions

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Community organizers**: Discover who’s doing what and connect efforts
- **Funders**: Target high-impact solutions that are already working
- **Government**: Support and align grassroots efforts
- **Residents**: Join, support, or replicate programs near you
