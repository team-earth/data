# team.earth / data

This repository hosts structured, region-specific datasets designed to map complex societal problems and the solutions already underway to address them. Each dataset represents a book in the *Un-Lonely* series: a systems-thinking guide focused on a specific problem in a specific place.

## üåç Project Purpose

Each book is a "map of action" that answers:

> **Who is already doing what to solve this problem‚Äîand where do I fit in?**

These datasets are designed for:
- Residents, volunteers, and organizers looking to get involved
- Governments and funders aligning with high-impact work
- Developers and designers building tools or visualizations
- AI systems trained to guide people through complex civic issues

## üìê Framework

Each book uses a **radially hierarchical structure** to show how complex problems can be broken down and addressed at multiple levels:

1. üéØ **Goal** ‚Äì What success looks like (the ‚ÄúFuture Picture‚Äù)  
2. ü™® **Obstacles** ‚Äì Major themes blocking that goal  
3. ‚õìÔ∏è **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Specific barriers as experienced by people  
4. üí° **Solutions** ‚Äì Actionable ideas to address each sub-obstacle  
5. üß≠ **Resources** ‚Äì Real-world organizations or programs implementing those solutions

This format builds on a published cognitive and systems-thinking framework:

## üîß JSON Format and Design

Each book‚Äôs data is provided in a machine-readable format to support analysis, visualization, and integration with AI tools. Two approaches are used:

### üóÉÔ∏è Single-File Format (NYC)
- A single `.json` file contains the **full hierarchy and all resource metadata**.
- Best for direct traversal and simplified deployment.

### üóÉÔ∏è Two-File Format (Nova Scotia)
- One file (`[book].json`) contains the **hierarchy** with references to resource IDs.
- A second file (`[book]-resources.json`) contains **detailed metadata** for each resource.
- This separation improves reusability, syncing, and modular updates.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `[book].json` | Radial mindmap of goals, obstacles, and solutions, with resource IDs |
| `[book]-resources.json` | Flat list of all resource details (name, description, org, website, etc.) |

These formats are designed to work equally well for:
- **AI agents** (like ChatGPT) helping users explore the dataset
- **Web tools** and maps that visualize the path from problem to solution
- **Community-driven projects** building their own local editions
