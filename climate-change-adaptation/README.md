# Climate Change Adaptation

This folder contains the full materials for the project **Climate Change Adaptation**, a systems-level outline of the challenges posed by climate change and practical ways to strengthen community resilience.

It includes:
- A publication in outline form (PDF)
- A machine-readable dataset (JSON)

## 🌟 Future Picture Statement

> “Our resilience for climate change adaptation is fortified.”

This dataset maps over 1,000 proposed solutions to climate-related threats, from biodiversity loss to coastal flooding. The book is designed to help communities recognize what’s already being done, coordinate more effectively, and take action in areas where gaps remain.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Climate Change Adaptation.pdf` — The complete guidebook with structured outlines and solution banks
- `climate-change-adaptation.json` — Hierarchical mindmap data for use in applications, visualizations, or simulations

## 📐 Structure of the Data

This book is organized as a **radially hierarchical mindmap**:

1. **Goal**  
   → *Fortify resilience for climate change adaptation*

2. **Obstacles**  
   → 8 major themes, such as “Food and Water Insecurity” and “Displacement and Migration”

3. **Sub-obstacles**  
   → Specific challenges like “Saltwater intrusion into farmland” or “Lack of infrastructure for climate refugees”

4. **Components**  
   → Nested issues within each sub-obstacle

5. **Solutions**  
   → Actionable, scalable responses from local, national, and global perspectives

Each solution is placed within the wider system so communities, funders, and governments can identify leverage points and avoid duplication.

## 📚 Introduction Summary (from Preface)

This book aims to:
- Surface **existing efforts** that already build resilience
- Identify gaps in adaptation and risk-reduction planning
- Show how small initiatives fit into a larger, systemic response
- Make climate adaptation more **visible**, **collaborative**, and **actionable**

It is intended as a *living document*, continuously updated to reflect new innovations and partnerships.

## ⚙️ How This Was Made

- Seeded with AI guidance to draft obstacle trees and solution banks
- Modeled on the F.L.O.W. framework for problem-solving (Future, Limiting factors, Opportunities, Workstreams)
- Refined using environmental science literature and policy experience
- Structured to support data visualization, public discussion, and program coordination

## ✨ Ways to Use

- Explore the mindmap to **see where your organization fits**
- Use as a guide for grantmaking, program planning, or advocacy
- Invite interdisciplinary teams to co-develop next steps under any theme
- Build digital maps and dashboards from the provided JSON structure
