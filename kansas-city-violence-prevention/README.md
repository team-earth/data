# Kansas City: Violence Prevention and Social Cohesion

This folder contains the complete structured outline, dataset, and resource links for the systems-level guidebook:  
**Kansas City: Violence Prevention and Social Cohesion**  
A framework to help the community understand the root causes of violence and strengthen safety through connection, opportunity, and trust.

## üåü Purpose

> **Future Picture Statement**: *Violence in Kansas City will be reduced, and communities will feel safer, more connected, and more cohesive.*

This book outlines key structural obstacles to safety and belonging in Kansas City. For each sub-obstacle, it proposes practical solutions and maps real-world organizations already implementing those approaches.

The entire structure follows a radially hierarchical model with five levels:

1. **Goal** ‚Äì A safer, more connected Kansas City  
2. **Major Obstacles** ‚Äì Root causes of violence and disconnection  
3. **Sub-Obstacles** ‚Äì Specific barriers in community life  
4. **Solutions** ‚Äì Actionable interventions  
5. **Resources** ‚Äì Programs and organizations doing the work

## üß† How the JSON Files Work Together

- `kansas-city-violence-prevention.json` defines the overall structure and references resource IDs at the outermost layer.
